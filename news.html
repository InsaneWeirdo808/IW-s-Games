        <div><article>I have made a simple music track for the game. I have redone the animations, (enemies actully have bodies now) added somethings to the map, added and FPS couter and
        Delta time to make the game feel more optimized.</article>
        
        <article>I've been working hard on the game for the past week now. The player is no longer a large block and has animation. The game is called "Blacklight" and you have to
        shine the light in a direction of an enemy to stun it. A very simple concept but it has potential to become something larger if I put my mind to it.</article></div>
