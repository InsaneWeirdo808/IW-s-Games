            This site was made orginally to host my game, BLACKLIGHT for the 2025 TSA (Technology Student Acc.) but is now just kinda like a blog and a hosting site for my games. The themes on the site are
        based on your computers theme, same thing with the font. The nav bar does work on mobile, but it is extremly small. I'm going to fix it soon. Now althouh I said this website hosts my games, most files for 
        the games have been lost, or are in unplayable states. The only working game right now, is GHOR my second game. And yes, I'm aware the site is very barebones. I'm going to update it over time.
