            Welcome to my (not so wonderful) website! This site simply hosts my old games from when I was younger. (found in the "Games" tab) More information can be found it the "About" tab. Below are my socials.

            The engine I use for my games is Scratch. Now before you get your pitchforks, I do not like Scratch. Well, baseline Scratch, that is. Since Scratch is open-source, there are plenty of modifications of
            the engine out there, so I do use Scratch, but only a modified version of it. Called Turbowarp, which makes projects run faster and has extensions like having gamepad support and APIs. But I understand 
            that Scrath is for begining programmers, after LOST COLONY, I will look for different game engines. Becuase I am simply getting tired of Scratch.

        <article>The rest of this site won't be as populated, becuase I'm still working on the site, so it feels very barebones.</article>
